-# Conclusion

I call RethinkDB is a database for programmer, not for database administrator
because it takes very minimal effort to understand and pick up it. The way
we write ReQL is very clear, other developer looks at it and know exactly
what is going on to happen. In SQL world, we have to profile, explain the
query to know if any index will be used. In RethinkDB, we tell it to use
an index. And it's ReQL language is a wonderful way to think about database.

Then coming changefeeds, which I didn't cover in this book because you can
quickly leanr and use it after reading 5 minutes API document.

It also offer automatic failover in cluster. Which I also didn't cover
because  I don't have experience using it. To me, all the upcoming thing for
RethinkDB is a good sign to invest into learning it. Be prepare and go ahead,
by learning and using RethinkDB today.

I hope that my little book helps you come into RethinkDB world.
